# Draw
Visual drawing tool

The goal is essentially to create the opposite of the (satirical) "[drw](https://programmingmadecomplicated.wordpress.com/2017/10/29/introducing-drw-a-useful-tool-to-solve-a-practical-problem/)" tool, and something akin to the visual editing described in the "Dump the parts bucket onto the floor" section of "[Learnable Programming](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/)". This will allow rapid development of code-specs for my "[Render](https://github.com/d-cook/Render)" tool, but without the cumbersome work or programming.
